Strangely, these men seem to snap out of their madness once removed some distance from the tears. \r\n\r\nThese . . . tears or, perhaps more accurately, fonts, require a not-insignificant amount of geistglass to stabilize. We’ve experimented with the geistglass along with various methods of reaching into the other side of the fonts. Small fragments of geistglass can be used as a conduit to entrap these accursed demons that storm through during the harvest moon.\r\n\r\nThere’s more work to be done, but there may be a way to make use of this information. Instead of simply unleashing the dead on the southerners, perhaps we can harness that rage. \r\n\r\nWhen I’m back on the mainland, we’ll creak open that bottle of Sorovian vodka.\r\n- Miles. "
